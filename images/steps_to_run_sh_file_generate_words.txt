Suppose I have a .txt file which contains 10 words 
and I want to write the words in font "andalemo"

First of all, I will install the fonts in ubuntu using

"sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts"

These fonts will be installed in folder
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts

Write the following shell script to generate images

FILE = "words.txt"
i=1
exec 0 < "$FILE" # read from file
n=0
while read -r line
do
a="$line"
convert -background white -fill black -font /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/andalemo.tif -pointsize 30 fill black -gravity center

label:"$a" "$i".tif
i=$($i+1)

done


How to execute .sh file?

Then, run the file as
